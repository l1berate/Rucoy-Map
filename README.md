# Rucoy-Map
This is an old utility script I made to make an array of valid coordianates in a 2d MMORPG called Rucoy Online. 
The picture of the map was extracted from the apk, and then was used to generate the valid coordinates for use in Rucoy Bot.
Also I seemed to have tested a bit how fast a python path finding library could find paths, and decided the current implementation
at the time was too slow for use in Rucoy Bot.
